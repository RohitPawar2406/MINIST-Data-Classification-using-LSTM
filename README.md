# MINIST-Data-Classification-using-LSTM

# CONCEPT :-
### Input Layer of 28x28 
### This means every row of each image is word so length of sequence is 28 and each word has 28 values of embedding features.

# CONCLUSION :- 
We have got training accuracy of 98.74 percent and evaluation accuracy of 98.64 percent.
